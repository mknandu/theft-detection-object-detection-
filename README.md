# Object Detection Project

This project aims to implement object detection using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Python 3.111.5. It consists of two main components:

1. **objectdetection.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the implementation of object detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow. It provides a step-by-step guide along with code snippets for detecting objects in images and/or video streams.

2. **camera.py**: This Python script is a simplified version for opening a camera and displaying the output in real-time. It serves as a basic demonstration of camera usage, which can be integrated with object detection algorithms for real-time object detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.111.5
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.111.5 installed. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python tensorflow
    ```

## Usage

1. ## Run
 `objectdetection.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to perform object detection on images or video streams.
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook objectdetection.ipynb
